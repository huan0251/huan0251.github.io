# Ming-Fei Huang's Portfolio

## How I created my web portfolio

>This web portfolio includes five pages like my original design in Adobe XD file. There is the Home page, About page, Portfolio page, Digital Graphic page, and Contact page. The Digital Graphic page is a category on the Portfolio page. I will do other categories in the future.

>This is my first time with the Boostrap in my HTML and integrates CSS to build web pages. In the beginning, I thought it is easier if I only use the Boostrap grid as my web layout, but most of my pages’ backgrounds are images. I try “background-image” in CSS, but I forgot the images’ size display with my contents, and they didn’t make responsive as well. To make them responsive and display the right size that I adjusted the images. I use Boostrap “.img-fluid” to solve the problem.

>Using Boostrap reduce me much time on writing flexbox and grid. The “-fluid” class helps me a lot in responsive container and image. I don’t need to resize the same image many times or use media queries to adjust different screen sizes. It is responsive smoother than before. But Boostrap has its shortcoming. Its default setting like fonts, colour, and some class name makes me have to write the same code in a different part. For example, I can’t just put “font-family: 'Prompt', sans-serif; “ in body. I have to put in specific div or class. For the time I save from layout, I think it is worth me to do the work. I still use media queries to make the detail variety. And I love to write CSS and see how my design will go.


## I learned by creating my web portfolio.

>My portfolio design is inspired by https://www.marleighculver.com/. I search some modern portfolio design, and I found this kind of layout is popular. So, I imitated the layout to do my web portfolio. I think the trickiest part in this kind of layout is “position”. The home page shows all parts in the website, but each part has its own background, like images or animation images. 
Fortunately, I encounter the problem from midterm project, and now I know how to applicate the “absolute” and “relative”.  

>I am very happy that I can build a web page all by my own. I built this web portfolio without changing my UX design. Although my design and web are not perfect, but I learned that when being a UX designer, my design should consider some practical of coding. Fancy design is good but give a hard time to developer. I think I need more practice to take the balance. I hope one day I can do a web portfolio which include some fancy animation to give people “WOW” feeling.
