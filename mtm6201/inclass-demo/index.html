        <li>Before I became a mother, I enjoy doing crafts and have a strong passion for design and arts in my leisure time. I used to integrate my hobbies into my teaching and teaching materials. I came to the IMD program because this is my second chance to learn what I am really interested in to become my future job.</li>
